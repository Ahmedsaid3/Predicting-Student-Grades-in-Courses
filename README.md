# Predicting Student Grades in Courses: A Clustering-Based Approach
My friend and I completed an unfinished project involving a new dataset that needed to be analyzed with our model. We began by preprocessing the dataset, then conducted various experiments and obtained meaningful results and visualizations. This was a valuable experience for both of us — we collaborated effectively and improved our skills, especially in using Pandas to clean, organize, and prepare the data to fit the model.

Throughout the project, we deepened our understanding of how models utilize K-Means clustering and collaborative filtering to predict student grades. We experimented with similarity metrics such as Euclidean distance, Jaccard index, and Pearson correlation.

In the end, we compared our model’s performance with state-of-the-art approaches and observed that our model achieved better results. Additionally, we contributed to an essay about the project. 

You can find the full project in the pinned repositories section of my GitHub profile.
